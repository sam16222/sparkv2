The linked video is clear and attracts users.|  
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 3 | Great animated video on [README.md](README.md) that shows why people should use the tool and launches into a brief demo.

This guide includes how the problem typically occurs and potential solutions to fix the issue. With this being said, there is no error messages that people should expect. Providing error messages would help these problems get diagnosed quicker and could be established to improve user experience in future iterations.  |
|If the software can be used as a library, package or service by other software, do the team provide comprehensive API documentation? | 3  | Not applicable. The services can not be used as an API. |
