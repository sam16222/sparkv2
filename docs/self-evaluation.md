|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others, but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 3 | From [GH Insights](https://github.com/SiddarthR56/spark/graphs/contributors), team members on average are each responsible for 25 commits. Participant commit distribution is normal and most group memebrs have committed a net 1000-1500 lines of code as well.  |
|Number of commits| 3 | From GH commits. Overall [40+ commits](https://github.com/SiddarthR56/spark/graphs/commit-activity) made to main and over 100+ commits total 25 averaging per person. |
|Number of commits: by different people| 2 | From [GH Insights](https://github.com/SiddarthR56/spark/pulse). 3 members of the group committed approximatly 3 times as much as the other group members. However, some people's commits had more code included in it, hence the 2 rather than 1.  |
|Issues reports: there are **many**| 3 | Over [10 issues listed](https://github.com/SiddarthR56/spark/pulse), each with several areas for improvement listed and/or specific tasks within the issue to be fixed. In addition, [issue templates](https://github.com/SiddarthR56/spark/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) have been created demonstrating thoroughness.  |
|Issues are being closed| 3 | At the time of submission, all issues have sparked discussions with teammates and have been closed. The only issues NOT closed are feature requests for the project extension. |
|DOI badge: exists| TODO | From GH within [README.md](README.md) |
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | TODO | |

The linked video is clear and attracts users.|  
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| TODO | | 
|Use of version control tools| 3 | Git utilized. Over 14 branches utilized and some commits reverted to. Proper version control practices were upheld.| 
|Use of style checkers | 3 | Style checker can be found [here](https://github.com/SiddarthR56/spark/blob/main/.github/workflows/lint.yml) |
|Use of code formatters. | 3 | Code checker utilized. [Evidence here](https://github.com/SiddarthR56/spark/blob/main/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml) Formats that pose issues are notified prior to users mergeing to main and will create security issues if a bad format has been identified. |

A small screen shot of a sample of text has been extracted as evidence: ![discord evidence](https://github.com/SiddarthR56/spark/blob/main/docs/documentation_photos/discord_evidence.jpg) |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.| TODO | |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 | All members contributing across branches. Development/testing has occured on multiple machines. Package.json and Package-lock.json provide a listing of the dependencies needed so that each participant can instantiate a directory with the same parameters.  |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| TODO | |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| TODO |  | 
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 2 | Most participants working across areas with a primary focus on one area. - Natalie supported frontend development, but worked to implement backend screen sharing functionality and provided documentation - Ashrita worked on volume client manipulation capability and documentation - Parth worked on workflows and gesture recognition testing - Siddarth supported the base socket connections and gesture recognition implementation and screen sharing debugging support - Kanishk worked on screen sharing functionalities and did some frontend work|
