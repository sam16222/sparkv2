We have the best hands free solution to your presentation needs! Have you ever presented to an audience and not had the ability to interact and change your meeting controls on the go? Spark is a solution to use gestures to change your volume and screen sharing settings while you present. You no longer need to type a value, instead just give your camera a gesture or react on the go during presentations. We guarantee it will _spark_ new conversations and be the most seemless, hands-free presentation you have had!

## Capabilities

- Allows multiple users to join a video conferencing web application
- Provides capabilities for user to be able to use gestures to manipulate the web conferencing interface.
  - Show a thumbs up **to change volume**
  - Swipe left or right to interact with your **screen sharing capabilities**.
  - Closed fist **to close the camera**
  - Closed fist with the thumb and little finger out **to disconnect the call**

## Worked Examples

1. User is directed to the homepage where they are asked to enter a room number they would like to join. If the room does not already exist, a new room will be created for the user, for example, Room 2 is created in our case here.

  <img src="docs/documentation_photos/JoinRoom.jpg" alt="drawing" width="480" />
</h1>

2. If another person wishes to join the room, they can simply enter the same room number to join the room. Currently, the application supports volume functions for mute/unmute, video on/off, and screen share functionality. Gesture recognition is enabled by default for the mute/unmute and screen sharing functionalities.

3. Users can leverage capabilities such gestures mentioned in the capabilities and react during conversations. In addition, users will also be able to disable gesture recognition by clicking the <b>Disable Gestures<b> button.

## Scaling Up
The application relies on WebRTC Protocol and employs the use of TURN servers and WebSockets to enable real-time communication between users through a mesh network created based on the room numbers. The application is built on top of the Express.js framework and uses Socket.io to enable real-time communication between users. The application is currently deployed on a single server and can be scaled up by deploying the application on multiple servers. The application can be scaled up by using a load balancer to distribute the load across multiple servers since it uses rooms for communication and we can configure the LB to distribute load based on the room numbers. The application can also be scaled up by using a cloud service provider such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform to distribute the load across multiple servers. You can refer to the diagram to get a better idea of how things work.
