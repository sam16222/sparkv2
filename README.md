We have the best hands free solution to your presentation needs! Have you ever presented to an audience and not had the ability to interact and change your meeting controls on the go? Spark is a solution to use gestures to change your volume and screen sharing settings while you present. You no longer need to type a value, instead just give your camera a gesture and keep on presenting. We guarantee it will *spark* new conversations and be the most seemless, hands-free presentation you have had! 

## Capabilities 

- Allows two users to join a video conferencing web application
- Provides capabilities for user to be able to use gestures to manipulate the web conferencing interface.
    - Show a thumbs up __to change volume__ 
    - Swipe left or right to interact with your __screen sharing capabilities__.

## Worked Examples

1. User is directed to the homepage where they are asked to enter a room number they would like to join. If the room does not already exist, a new room will be created for the user, for example, Room 2 is created in our case here.

2. If another person wishes to join the room, they can simply enter the same room number to join the room. Currently, the application supports volume functions for mute/ unmute, video on/off, and screen share functionality. Gesture recognition is enabled by default for the mute/unmute and screen sharing functionalities.

3. By showing thumbs up/ down action towards the camera, either of the two users will be able to mute/ unmute their microphones. Similarly swipe left/ right action towards the camera will allow the users to share their screens with each other. In addition, users will also be able to disable gesture recognition by clicking the <b>Disable Gestures<b> button.
